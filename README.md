# deepsee
Database for creating and sharing open source computer vision datasets

# Stack
- Frontend: HTML/CSS, htmx
    - no formal JS frontend framework for now
- Backend: FastAPI


# Plan
- Similar format to Ollama.ai for Models Tab and each Model page with title, description, metdata, and tabs for Overview (and Images in this case, Model/API tabs in the future)
- Show list of all available datasets
- Allow users to create account/sign in and create datasets
- Show last updated date
- Users can restricted size images to their dataset
- Show overall metrics such as average image size, number of images, etc. (reference Roboflow Universe for inspiration)
- show logo top left, github in top right (with stars, forks, version)
- have tags/versions for previous versions with their image dataset metrics, accuracy, precision, classes, size, etc. so user doesn't have to use the newest model
- show all models on home page with view more at bottom. filter to sort them by some metric
